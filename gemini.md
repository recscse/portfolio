## 🛠️ Maintenance Guide

### 1. How to Add a New Blog Post

I created a template to make this easy.

1.  **Copy the Template:**
    Duplicate `blog/_template.html` and rename it (e.g., `blog/my-new-post.html`).
2.  **Edit Content:**
    *   Update the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`.
    *   Update the `post-title`, date, and tags in the header.
    *   Write your content using standard HTML (`p`, `h2`, `ul`).
    *   Use `<div class="diagram-box">` for ASCII diagrams (see template for example).
3.  **Register the Post:**
    Open `blog/index.html` and add a new entry to the `posts` array in the `<script>` section:
    ```javascript
    {
      title: "My New Post Title",
      date: "2025-12-28",
      summary: "A short summary of what this post is about.",
      tags: ["Java", "System Design"],
      url: "my-new-post.html"
    },
    ```

### 2. How to Add a New Project

1.  Open `projects.html`.
2.  Scroll down to the `projects` array in the `<script>` section.
3.  Add a new object:
    ```javascript
    {
      title: "New Project Name",
      description: "Short description.",
      category: ["java", "system"], // Categories for filtering
      tags: ["Spring Boot", "AWS"],
      status: "Live", // or "WIP", "Archived"
      icon: "bx-rocket", // Boxicon class
      link: "https://github.com/...",
      demo: "https://demo-link.com", // Optional
      highlights: [
        "Bullet point 1",
        "Bullet point 2"
      ]
    }
    ```

### 3. How to Change Colors (Theming)

All colors are defined as CSS variables in `mystyle.css` (for main site) and `blog/blog.css` (for blog).

*   **Primary Color:** Change `--primary` (currently `#3b82f6` - Blue).
*   **Accent Color:** Change `--accent` (currently `#8b5cf6` - Purple).
*   **Background:** Change `--bg-body` and `--bg-dots`.

### 4. File Structure

*   `mystyle.css`: Styles for `index.html`, `projects.html`, `skills.html`.
*   `blog/blog.css`: Styles specifically for the blog pages (typography is slightly different for reading).
*   `assets/`: Keep your images and SVGs here.
